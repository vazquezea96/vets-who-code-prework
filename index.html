      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p class="text-info">
        Hello, my name is Eduardo. I currently work as a security guard at
        Allied Universal, trying to transition into tech. As a Software
        Engineer. I currently went through a program called Year Up that was a
        year long, split into 6 months of Learning and Development, I learned
        the basics of Web Development, Project management, soft skills, and
        interview/career prep. After that, I did a 6 month internship at JP
        Morgan Chase for the last 6 months of the program, where I learned and
        used Python, AWS and Terraform. Since graduating in March, I am left
        with a gap in knowledge, so I have been upskilling on my own and trying
        to build some projects. But I truly believe I work better in a
        structured environment alongside a team.
